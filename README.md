# Monorail

## On Prototype PCBs, for RGB underglow to work correctly, the solder jumper labeled "5VLED" must be bridged with a blob of solder.
If that solder jumper is not bridged with solder, then the RGB LEDs will not work.

Steam Vanagon and Diesel Hull plates are known working. The remianing plate files are untested, but are made up of the same outlines as are found in the Trashman Wiki.

The "Combined" plates have support for all of the layouts from all three PCBs.
