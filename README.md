# Monorail V2

Version 2 is based on the RP2040 and has encoder positions on ESC, 1, and 6.

Plate files made up of the same outlines as are found in the Trashman Wiki, and enough permutations have been tested to be confident in their functionality.

The "Combined" plates have support for all of the layouts from all three PCBs.

Vial firmware was built on this commit of the NCKiser fork of Vial, based on QMK v0.18 : https://github.com/NCKiser/vial-nckiser/commit/2a0371c2ef1b1343f7dda704ad11ff06da6e896c
